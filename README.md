# Developing a Customer Churn Prediction System for T-Mobile: An Analysis of Customer Behavior and Feedback.

## Project Idea
This project aims to create a customer prediction system for a telecommunication company, preferably T-Mobile, which analyzes customer behavior and feedback to predict which customers are most likely to leave the company and switch to a different network. It seeks to explore two key questions:

1. What traits do customers who are likely to remain with the company share?
1. Why are customers leaving the company?

The ultimate objective of this project is to shed light on the reasons behind customer attrition, allowing companies like T-Mobile to allocate resources more efficiently, improve their services, and retain more customers in the future. From the customer's perspective, the project aims to highlight the characteristics of an excellent network company (as per the first research question) compared to its rivals. Furthermore, the project will adhere to the ethical regulations of the featured companies.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To develop a customer prediction system that accurately predicts which customers are most likely to leave the company and switch to a different network.
2. To investigate the similarities among customers who are most likely to stay with the company.
3. To identify the reasons why customers are leaving the company.
4. To adhere to the ethical regulations set by the project's featured companies.

## Project Scope
The scope of this project encompasses the following:

1. Collecting and cleaning relevant data related to customer behavior and feedback.
2. Developing and training a NLP model to forecast customer churn.
3. Analyzing the results of the machine learning model to investigate the similarities among customers who are most likely to stay with the company.
4. Retrieving and Analyzing surveys or interviews with customers to determine why they are leaving the company.
5. Creating a report that summarizes the project's findings and provides recommendations for T-Mobile and other telecommunication companies.

## Project Deliverables
The following deliverables will be provided at the end of the project:

1. A NLP model that predicts customer churn.
2. A report that summarizes the project's findings and offers suggestions for T-Mobile and other telecommunication companies.
3. Data visualizations that aid in the interpretation of the project's results.
4. A list of the ethical regulations that were followed during the project.

## Project Timeline (Rough Estimate & Tasks will likely Overlap)
The project will be completed in four phases:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning (1 week)
2. NLP Model Development (2 weeks)
3. Customer Surveys/Interviews and Data Analysis (1 week)
4. Report Writing and Presentation (1 weeks)

## Conclusion
The customer prediction system for a telecommunication company, especially T-Mobile, will provide insights into customer behavior and feedback. By identifying the reasons behind customer churn, this project will enable telecommunication companies to allocate resources more efficiently, improve their services, and retain more customers in the future. The project will also provide information about the characteristics of an excellent network company compared to its rivals, from the customer's perspective.
